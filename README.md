# Gidget 4 Engine Research

`gidget-game.js` and `index.html` only exist for the purposes of showcasing `gidget-engine.js`.  
`gidget-engine.js` is portable and can be hooked into by any type of UI library.

**TODO:**
  * More validation
    * Input
    * Board size
    * Inventory
  * Return success state
  * Simplify callback into one method
  * Tests
